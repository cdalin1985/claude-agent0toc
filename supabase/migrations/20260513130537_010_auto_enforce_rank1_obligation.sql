-- Recovered from Supabase migration history (version 20260513130537).
-- Source: supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
-- Name: 010_auto_enforce_rank1_obligation

-- Auto-enforce the rank-1 obligation.
--
-- The #1 player must play two top-5 opponents within 30 days of becoming #1
-- or be moved to #10. Until now this was a manual button (Enforce Now) — and
-- a buggy "Check Status" path that silently triggered it as a side effect.
-- Both of those have been fixed; now this is the durable, no-human-required
-- enforcement path that runs on a schedule.
--
-- The function is safe to call repeatedly. On each run it does at most ONE
-- thing:
--   1. If there's no #1 player, no-op.
--   2. If the #1 player's rank1_since is NULL, initialize it to NOW.
--   3. If they're within 30 days, no-op.
--   4. If they're past 30 days AND have ≥2 confirmed top-5 matches, no-op.
--   5. Otherwise: demote them via apply_rank1_penalty, write a notification,
--      write an activity-feed entry, and start the new #1's 30-day clock.
--
-- It returns a JSON blob describing what it did. Useful for the cron job's
-- log output, useful for manually invoking via SELECT to test.
