# Top of the Capital 🎱

**A competitive pool ranking list for Helena, Montana.**

TOC is a live challenge league where players fight for the top spot on a single ranked list. Think of it like a boxing ranking — you climb by beating the people above you, one rack at a time. No seasons, no brackets. Just a living leaderboard that shifts every time someone wins.

## How the List Works

Every player holds a numbered rank. To move up, you challenge players above you and win. Beat someone higher than you and you take their spot — everyone between you drops one.

### Who You Can Challenge

- **First challenge ever** — you can challenge anyone up to 10 spots above you
- **After your first** — you can challenge anyone up to 5 spots above you
- **Top 10 players** — can challenge up or down 5 spots
- **#1 ranked player** — can challenge anyone, but must play at least one top-5 opponent at least twice every 30 days or drops to #10

### Challenge Rules

- Maximum **2 challenges per week** (rolling 7-day window from your first challenge of the week)
- You must play the first person who challenged you before accepting any others
- The challenged player has **48 hours to respond**
- Once accepted, the match must be played within **10 days**

---

## After a Match

**If you win (lower seed beats higher seed):**
You take their spot. They drop one. Everyone between your old spot and theirs also drops one. You must wait 24 hours before challenging up again.

**If you defend your spot (higher seed wins):**
You can challenge up immediately — but you must post that challenge with your match results to lock it in.

**If you lose:**
You must either defend your new position or wait 24 hours before challenging up.

**If the challenged player declines:**
The challenger takes their spot automatically (confirmed by admin).

**If you can't agree on a time:**
The challenge is a wash. No penalties for either player.
